"whats doin'?" ... "not much, yourself?"


***whatsdoin*** is a rudimentary CLI todo list. The user can add and remove tasks, as well as toggle task completion.

###  About
I wanted a todo list and have been learning C++. After learning the languages basic control flow I threw this together. I intend on updating this project as I learn more about the language.
